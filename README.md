# S3
This is an architecture design where a new service is created to allows users to upload, store, and share files securely. The files can range from small text documents to large media files

**Architecture Breakdown**



**1. User Interface**


● **Purpose:** Allows users to upload files, view file metadata, and manage sharing options.

**Key Services:**

**○ Amazon S3:** Acts as the primary storage for uploaded files.

**○ Amazon SNS:** Sends notifications (e.g., upload success, sharing link).

**Enhancements:**

○ Integrate Amazon CloudFront for faster file delivery and caching, especially for large media files.

○ Add Amazon Cognito for authentication and authorization (managing user
sessions and roles).

**2. Monitoring and Security**

● **AWS Shield:** Protects against DDoS attacks.

**Encryption:**

○ Ensure data at rest is encrypted using S3 default encryption (SSE-S3 or
SSE-KMS).

○ Use HTTPS to secure data in transit.


**IAM Policies:**

○ Implement least-privilege access using fine-grained IAM roles and policies.

**Suggestions:**

○ Add AWS WAF to protect the web application layer (integrated with
CloudFront).

○ Use AWS CloudTrail to audit and log user and API activities for security and compliance.

**3. Microservices**

**Purpose:** Handles workflows for uploading, sharing, and managing files.

**Key Services:**

**○ AWS Step Functions:** Orchestrates workflows like file upload handling and metadata processing.

**○ AWS Lambda:** Executes tasks like generating pre-signed URLs, validating user inputs, or managing metadata.

**○ Amazon DynamoDB:** Stores metadata and file-sharing configurations.

**Enhancements:**

○ Add retry mechanisms in Step Functions for fault tolerance.

○ Use DynamoDB streams for event-driven triggers (e.g., updating analytics when metadata changes).

**4. File Storage and Processing**

**Amazon S3:**

○ Upload bucket for raw files.

○ Processed bucket for transcoded/optimized files.

**Suggestions:**

○ Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration to speed up uploads for users in distant
locations.

○ Use S3 Object Lambda for custom processing on file retrieval, such as
on-the-fly watermarking or image resizing.

**5. Analytics**

● **Amazon Athena:** Runs queries on S3 data (e.g., usage reports, download statistics).

● **Amazon QuickSight:** Visualizes analytics data (e.g., storage usage trends, most-shared files).

**Suggestions:**

○ Automate periodic data aggregation using AWS Glue for ETL jobs before Athena queries.

○ Use QuickSight to generate real-time dashboards for both user and admin
monitoring.

**6. Notifications**

● **Amazon SNS:** Sends alerts or notifications to users (e.g., file upload status, link expiration reminders).

**Enhancements:**
○ Add SMS or push notifications for critical updates using Amazon SNS Mobile
Push or integrations with external notification services.

**7. Admin Interface**

● **Purpose:** Enables administrators to manage the platform (monitor storage usage, view system logs, and manage user roles).

**Key Services:**

○ Integrated with QuickSight for analytics dashboards.

○ Possibly backed by Amazon RDS or DynamoDB for user and system
management.

**Suggestions:**

○ Use AWS Systems Manager to monitor system health and run operational tasks.
Additional Enhancements

**1. Scalability:**

○ Use AWS Auto Scaling with Lambda and DynamoDB to handle spikes in traffic.
○ Add Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) if you introduce compute services (e.g.,
EC2).

**2. Cost Optimization:**
○ Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for cost-effective storage of infrequently accessed files.

○ Use Athena Workgroups to control query costs.

**3. Testing and Validation:**

○ Enable AWS Fault Injection Simulator to test your system's resilience.

**Step Functions**

AWS Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that helps you coordinate and manage multiple AWS services into scalable workflows. It allows developers to design workflows as state machines, which represent a series of steps, transitions, and conditions.

Workflow Example

**1. Upload Workflow:**

○ User uploads a file via a pre-signed S3 URL.

○ S3 triggers an event (e.g., new object created) to notify the Lambda for
post-processing.

○ Lambda processes the file (e.g., resizing or transcoding for media).

○ Processed file stored in the "Processed Bucket."

**2. Share Workflow:**

○ User requests to share a file.

○ Pre-signed URL generated and returned to the user.
